## Introduction

This repository extends the capabilities of the [Databricks Slack Bot](https://github.com/alex-lopes-databricks/databricks_apps_collection/tree/main/slack-bot) by [Alex Lopes](https://github.com/alex-lopes-databricks), allowing users to deploy a Slack app on Databricks Apps. The primary enhancement is the integration with Databricks Genie through Slack, leveraging Databricks Asset Bundles for deployment.

## Credits

- **Original Repository:** [Databricks Slack Bot](https://github.com/alex-lopes-databricks/databricks_apps_collection/tree/main/slack-bot) by [Alex Lopes](https://github.com/alex-lopes-databricks).
- **Enhancements:** This repository builds upon the original by incorporating Databricks Asset Bundles to facilitate interaction with Databricks Genie via Slack.

## Features

- **Databricks Genie Integration:** Users can now interact with Databricks Genie directly from Slack, enhancing collaboration and workflow efficiency.
- **Databricks Asset Bundles:** Utilizes Databricks Asset Bundles (DABs) for streamlined deployment of the Slack app on Databricks Apps.
- **Slack App Deployment:** Simplifies the process of deploying a Slack app within the Databricks environment.
- **Secret Scope Setup:** Sets up a secret scope to store Slack app and bot tokens

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **Databricks CLI:** Ensure you have the Databricks CLI installed and configured for your workspace. Refer to [Databricks CLI Installation](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/cli/install.html) for setup instructions.
2. **Slack App Creation:** Create a Slack app and obtain necessary credentials. Follow the steps in the [original repository](https://github.com/alex-lopes-databricks/databricks_apps_collection/tree/main/slack-bot) for guidance.
3. **Environment:** Set up environment variables in the terminal which you will run the DABs commands. This can be done how you wish but below walks through a method that uses a .env file that is loaded by the [Python extension in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#:~:text=By%20default%2C%20the%20Python%20extension,(see%20General%20Python%20settings).).
   - In databricks.yml, replace the target host with your databricks host url
   - Create a `.env` file in the root of your repository.
   - Add the following environment variables:
     - `BUNDLE_VAR_TOKEN_APP`: Your Slack app token.
     - `BUNDLE_VAR_TOKEN_BOT`: Your Slack bot token.
     - `BUNDLE_VAR_GENIE_SPACE_ID`: The ID of the Genie space you want the Slack app to interface with.

    The two env variables TOKEN_APP and TOKEN_BOT is passed through DABs as secrets to be used by the app using dbutils whereas the genie space ID is passed through DABs as a environment variable in the Databricks App's startup to be picked up by the app code.

4. **UC Permission Setup:** Grant the app service principal access to tables set up with your genie room as well as the room itself and the warehouse to run the room on.

### Warning
**Experimental DABS Features:** To automate the population of secrets within the secret scope from local environment variables, this DABS project uses [experimental post-deployment script](https://github.com/databricks/cli/pull/632) which may change at any time.
